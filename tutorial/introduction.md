# Introduction

`CanvasUI` is a canvas-based UI framework. `It draws complex page on one <canvas>.`

As we all know, the canvas API only provides very low-level operations such as drawLine / drawRect / fillColor, and it will be extremely cumbersome to use these APIs to build complex user interface.

CanvasUI frees you from such a tedious process.

It `re-implements` key technologies of modern front-end development based on HTML &lt;canvas&gt; (just using Vanilla JS, no external dependency), it contains:
- Declarative tags (e.g. &lt;button&gt;, &lt;image&gt;, and even &lt;input&gt;)
- Layout engine that supports Flex
- Commonly used CSS
- MVVM
- Timeline and Animation
- Mobile-compatible gestures
- Scaffolding out of the box and development server that supports hot reload

As long as you can use HTML / CSS / JavaScript to write code, then you can get started directly.
