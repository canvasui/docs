# Usage

1. Create a project with `npx canvasui project-name`
2. Use vscode to open the project root directory to enjoy code highlighting
3. Run `npm run build` in the root directory of the project to start the development server (the code will also be packaged into the `/public` directory)
4. Use a browser to visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
5. Modify `main.ui` in the `/src` directory, the browser will update and modify in real time (and package it to the `/public` directory at the same time)
